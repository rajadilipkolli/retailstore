# Development

## Build & Run Commands

```bash
./mvnw                            # Run in dev mode (default goal: spring-boot:run)
./mvnw clean package              # Production build (JAR in target/)
./mvnw test                       # Run all tests
./mvnw test -Dtest=ClassName      # Run a single test class
```

The app runs on port 8080 (configurable via `PORT` env var).

For local development, activate the `dev` Spring profile and inject `APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
at runtime. This creates the administrator with that password only if the account does
not already exist. Later startups leave its credentials unchanged. Do not put the password
in source or committed configuration.

## Docker

To build a Docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t my-application:latest .
```

If you use commercial components, pass the license key as a build secret:

```bash
docker build --secret id=proKey,src=$HOME/.vaadin/proKey .
```
